Hi, i'm known as Wallen in the gaming community, i like to build things, solve design and technical problems in the digital world. 

I am a Software Engineer at ****** and i mainly build website applications using C# but also NodeJS.
Currently i'm working on several private projects also most of my repos are archived because i don't really wish to maintain many of these projects anymore.
